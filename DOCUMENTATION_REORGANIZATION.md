# 📚 Documentation Reorganization Complete

## ✅ What Changed

All documentation has been reorganized into a centralized `docs/` folder for better organization and clarity.

### Documentation Structure (New)

```
YOLO/
├── README.md                    ← Main project readme (STAYS HERE)
├── docs/                        ← 📚 All documentation
│   ├── INSTALLATION.md          # Setup & installation guide
│   ├── DATASET_GUIDE.md         # Dataset preparation & tools
│   ├── TRAINING_GUIDE.md        # Complete training guide
│   ├── QUICK_REFERENCE.md       # Command cheat sheet
│   └── RTX5080_OPTIMIZED.md     # GPU optimization tips
```

### File Structure

| Location | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Root | `README.md` | Project overview, quick start, links to docs |
| docs/ | `INSTALLATION.md` | Installation steps, troubleshooting |
| docs/ | `DATASET_GUIDE.md` | Dataset preparation, annotation tools |
| docs/ | `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` | Training configuration, optimization |
| docs/ | `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Command cheat sheet |
| docs/ | `RTX5080_OPTIMIZED.md` | GPU-specific optimization |

## 🔗 Documentation Links

All links in the main README have been updated to point to the docs folder:

```markdown
- [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
- [Dataset Guide](docs/DATASET_GUIDE.md)
- [Training Guide](docs/TRAINING_GUIDE.md)
- [Quick Reference](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- [RTX 5080 Optimization](docs/RTX5080_OPTIMIZED.md)
```

## 📖 Getting Started

The recommended reading order:

1. **Start here**: `README.md` - Overview and quick start
2. **Setup**: `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Get everything installed
3. **Prepare data**: `docs/DATASET_GUIDE.md` - Organize your dataset
4. **Train**: `docs/TRAINING_GUIDE.md` - Start training
5. **Reference**: `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command cheat sheet
