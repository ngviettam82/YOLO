# YOLO11 Training Configuration
# Optimized for Maximum Performance and Accuracy

# Model Selection
# Options: yolo11n.pt (nano), yolo11s.pt (small), yolo11m.pt (medium), 
#          yolo11l.pt (large), yolo11x.pt (xlarge)
# Recommendation: yolo11m.pt for best balance of speed and accuracy
model: yolo11m.pt

# Image size (pixels)
# Larger = more accurate but slower training
# Options: 640 (fast), 832 (balanced), 1024 (accurate)
# Set to 640 for fast training
image_size: 640

# Batch size (adjust based on your GPU VRAM)
# RTX 5080 (16GB): 40-48 recommended (optimized for Blackwell architecture)
# RTX 4090 (24GB): 48-64 recommended
# RTX 4070 Ti Super (16GB): 32 recommended
# RTX 4060 Ti (8GB): 16 recommended
# Increased to 64 for fast training with 640 resolution
batch_size: 64

# Training epochs
# More epochs = better training but longer time
# Increased to 1000 for maximum accuracy with early stopping at 150
epochs: 1000

# Data loading workers
# More workers = faster data loading
# Set to number of CPU cores (Intel Ultra 7 265K has 20 cores)
# Recommended: 12-16 workers for high-end systems
workers: 16

# Early stopping patience
# Stop training if no improvement after N epochs
# Increased to 150 for more aggressive training before stopping
patience: 150

# Advanced Settings (Optional)
# Uncomment and modify if needed

# Learning rate settings
# lr0: 0.01              # Initial learning rate
# lrf: 0.0001            # Final learning rate

# Augmentation settings (enabled for maximum accuracy)
mosaic: 1.0            # Mosaic augmentation
mixup: 0.2             # MixUp augmentation (increased from 0.15)
copy_paste: 0.5        # Copy-paste augmentation (increased from 0.3)
degrees: 20.0          # Rotation augmentation (increased from 15)
translate: 0.3         # Translation augmentation (increased from 0.2)
scale: 0.85            # Scale augmentation (decreased range for stability)

# GPU memory settings
fraction: 0.95         # Use 95% of GPU memory
amp: true              # Automatic Mixed Precision (FP16)
