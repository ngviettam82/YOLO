# YOLO11 Training Configuration
# Optimized for Maximum Performance and Accuracy

# Model Selection
# Options: yolo11n.pt (nano), yolo11s.pt (small), yolo11m.pt (medium), 
#          yolo11l.pt (large), yolo11x.pt (xlarge)
# Recommendation: yolo11m.pt for best balance of speed and accuracy
model: yolo11m.pt

# Image size (pixels)
# Larger = more accurate but slower training
# Options: 640 (fast), 832 (balanced), 1024 (accurate)
image_size: 832

# Batch size (adjust based on your GPU VRAM)
# RTX 5080 (16GB): 40-48 recommended (optimized for Blackwell architecture)

# RTX 4070 Ti Super (16GB): 32 recommended
# RTX 4060 Ti (8GB): 16 recommended
batch_size: 40

# Training epochs
# More epochs = better training but longer time
# Recommendation: 500 with early stopping
epochs: 500

# Data loading workers
# More workers = faster data loading
# Set to number of CPU cores (Intel Ultra 7 265K has 20 cores)
# Recommended: 12-16 workers for high-end systems
workers: 12

# Early stopping patience
# Stop training if no improvement after N epochs
patience: 100
